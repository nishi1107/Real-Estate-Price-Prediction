# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
Real Estate Price Prediction, predicts the house price in Banglore city.
I have used Bengaluru_House_Data.csv dataset from Kaggle. 
I have used sklearn and Linear Regression to build the model. 
Secondly i have written python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 
Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bhks, area, etc and it will call the python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 
Technology and tools wise this project covers :
 1. Python.
 2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning.
 3. Matplotlib for data visualization.
 4. Sklearn for model building.
 5. Jupyter notebook and pycharm as IDE.
